He is walking into a trap of such arcane complexity that even the one who drew him there has no idea of its true terrors.

The trail leads to one of the less travelled parts of Hell itself, and there Cabal will need a guide. As Dante had his Virgil, so Cabal employs the services of a devil who is a monster, a predator, and -- most alien of all to Cabal -- a woman. The devil Zarenyia and he delve deep into Hell, even into Satan's greatest mistake, to confront challenges quite outside the ken of any mortal.

Lovecraft mythos into the twenty-first century, optioned by Warner Bros TV. Daniel Carter used to be a homicide detective, but his last case -- the hunt for a serial killer -- went wrong in strange ways and soured the job for him. Now he's a private investigator trying to live a quiet life. Strangeness, however, has not finished with him. First he inherits a bookstore in Providence from someone he's never heard of, along with an indignant bookseller who doesn't want a new boss. She's Emily Lovecraft, the last known descendant of H.P. Lovecraft, the writer from Providence who told tales of the Great Old Ones and the Elder Gods, creatures and entities beyond the understanding of man. Then people start dying in impossible ways, and while Carter doesn't want to be involved, but he's beginning to suspect that someone else wants him to be. As he reluctantly investigates, he discovers that Lovecraft's tales were more than just fiction, and he must accept another unexpected, and far more unwanted inheritance.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781466866652"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1466866659"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 11, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.3.3.0.preview.2", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Johannes_Cabal&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://market.android.com/details?id=book-iv65BwAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 7.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 7.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-iv65BwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 7990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Carter_Lovecraft-sample-epub.acsm?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=iv65BwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "From author Jonathan L.

Lovecraft mythos into the twenty-first century. The Unfolded World is a bitter and unfriendly place for Daniel Carter and Emily Lovecraft. In this world, the Cold War never happened because the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1941. In this world the Nazi Gro\u00dfdeutschland is the premier superpower, and is not merely tolerated but indulged because, in this world, the Holocaust happened behind the ruins of the Iron Curtain and consumed only Bolsheviks, Communists, and others the West was glad to see gone. In this world, there are monsters, and not all of them are human. But even in the Unfolded World, there are still bills to pay and jobs to do. Carter finds himself working for the German secret security service to uncover the truth behind a major scientific joint project that is going suspiciously well. The trail takes Lovecraft and him to a distant, abandoned island, and a conspiracy that threatens everything. To fight it, Lovecraft must walk a perilously narrow path between forbidden knowledge and soul-destroying insanity. Fortunately, she also has a shotgun.", "industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13", "identifier": "9781466866669"}, {"type": "ISBN_10", "identifier": "1466866667"}], "readingModes": {"text": true, "image": false}, "pageCount": 320, "printType": "BOOK", "categories": ["Fiction"], "averageRating": 4.0, "ratingsCount": 4, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "allowAnonLogging": true, "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.2", "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "language": "en", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Johannes_Cabal&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=9&source=gbs_api", "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api", "canonicalVolumeLink": "https://market.android.com/details?id=book-O5W8DgAAQBAJ"}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "FOR_SALE", "isEbook": true, "listPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amount": 13.99, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-O5W8DgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api", "offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1, "listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 13990000.0, "currencyCode": "USD"}, "giftable": true}]}, "accessInfo": {"country": "US", "viewability": "PARTIAL", "embeddable": true, "publicDomain": false, "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "epub": {"isAvailable": true, "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/After_the_End_of_the_World-sample-epub.acsm?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"}, "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=O5W8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api", "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE", "quoteSharingAllowed": false}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "After the End of the World by Jonathan L.
